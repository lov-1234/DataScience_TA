## Overview  

This repository contains the tutorial materials, exercises, and supplementary notebooks I prepared and delivered as the **Teaching Assistant (TA)** for the course **Introduction to Data Science (BDS)**.  

The tutorials were designed to complement the theoretical lectures with hands-on practice in **Python** and **R**, covering the essential stages of the data science workflow — from data acquisition and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, modeling, and interpretation.
